# Simple Cell Evolution
Cell evolution using a genetic algorithm

This project represents the evolution of cells, where each cell can eat others or reproduce using a genetic algorithm. Here's what came out in the end:

# Basic rules

Each cell has its own energy, genome, color, and more. The genome is a list of size 64, containing numbers from 0 to 64. Each number represents a command, for example, 25 stands for photosynthesis. When a command is executed, a number is added to a special "counter". When the "counter" reaches 64, the cell finishes its turn.

When a cell's energy reaches 650, reproduction occurs. If there is space around, the cell divides, and one number in the genome mutates with a certain probability. 
However, when a cell has more than 5 children, it dies.

# How to start a simulation

You just need to run the 'main' file.

Also, the project uses the "numpy" and "pygame" libraries, which must be installed on you.

# Project problems


The project has a problem. 

Ð¡ells have too simple rules and cells cannot have complex behavior. So the simulation looks simple
